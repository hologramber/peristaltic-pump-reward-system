- Peristaltic Liquid Pump (12VDC / 300mA) with Silicone Tubing
- 12VDC Adapter (leftover wall adapter) to power the motor
- Programmable device to control motor activity:
	- [Option 1] Raspberry Pi Model B
	- [Option 2] Arduino Uno (Or Similar) 
	- [Option 3] Your alternative controller of choice.
- Some way of routing power to/driving the motor:
	- [Option 1] L293D [ http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/l293d.pdf ]
	- [Option 2: Arduino Only] Seeed Studio Motor Shield (or other shield)
	- [Option 3] Power Transistor
- [Optional] Momentary Push Button/Switch for manual fluid delivery
- [Optional] Something to house the components (I like OpenBeam or MakerSlide)
